the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. </font></div><table

Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.&#160; LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform.&#160; On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\")  announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.&#160; On November 18, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"), the administrator of USD LIBOR, announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, IBA, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors.  While the November 30th announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established such that LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference rate(s).&#160; Several offerings of securities that include such an alternative reference rate have now been completed by other companies. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial&#8217;s  borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.&#160; With respect to Insurance Services\\' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Times New Roman\\',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.</span></div><div><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Times New Roman\\',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">&#160;</span></div><div><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Times New Roman\\',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers.

Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial\\'s and our earnings and cash flows.

We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 6 &#8212; &#8220;Income taxes&#8221; and Note 22 &#8212; &#8220;Environmental and legal matters&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; to this Annual Report on Form 10-K</span><span style=\"color:#1f497d;font-family:\\'Times New Roman\\',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Times New Roman\\',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.</span></div><div><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Times New Roman\\',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">&#160;</span></div><div><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Times New Roman\\',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world.
